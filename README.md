# Flarum

Adapted to higher education in Norway, which includes an extension for authentication via Dataporten.

Built to work with Flarum `v0.1.0-beta.5`.

## Install

As you will need to populate a Flarum configuration file before build, first clone this repository.

### 1. etc/flarum/config.yml

Populate Flarum's config-file used for command-line install, which will be used by Docker build. 

If you have already registered your client with Dataporten, you may enter its ID/Secret in the config file. Otherwise, you may set it manually in Flarum's Admin UI after the build/run.


```
baseUrl : "http://127.0.0.1/path_to_flarum/"
databaseConfiguration :
    host : "localhost"
    database : "flarum_database_name"
    prefix: "flarum_table_name_prefix_"
    username : "username"
    password : "password"
adminUser : 
    username : "adminuser"
    password : "adminpassword"
    password_confirmation : "adminpassword"
    email : "admin@email.com"
settings : 
    forum_title : "Flarum Site Title"
    forum_title           : "Dataporten Test Forum"
    welcome_title         : "Velkommen til Dataporten Test Forum"
    welcome_message       : "Bare for testing :)"
    uninett-auth-dataporten.client_id     : "___optional___"
    uninett-auth-dataporten.client_secret : "___optional____"
    mail_from             : "noreply@dataporten.dev"
    default_locale        : "no"
    theme_colored_header  : 1
    theme_primary_color   : "#ed1b34"
    theme_secondary_color : "#010777"
```

### 2. Build

Run the following from the directory in which you cloned the repo:

> docker build -t uninettno/dataporten-flarum-docker .


## After Build

### Run

On port 80:

	> docker run -d -p 80:80 --name flarum uninettno/dataporten-flarum-docker

Remember to disable any web-servers running on host (to free port 80).

### Enable Dataporten

Log on to Flarum with the `adminUser` credentials (set in config.yml) and enable Dataporten extension in Flarum's Admin UI.

More info about Dataporten in the [Dataporten extension readme on GitHub](https://github.com/skrodal/flarum-ext-auth-dataporten).

### Debug

	> docker exec -ti flarum bash

### Stop
	
	> docker stop flarum && docker rm flarum

## Issues/todo

Avatars (profile photo) will be lost on Docker restart (as it is downloaded and saved locally within the image). Using external image links [is not supported by Flarum](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/3041-upload-avatar-to-imgur)
